Please use Python 2.7 to perform the following task:

Write a re­usable library to parse BitTorrent files. The library should expose at least the

following pieces of information (when available in the file):

­ creation date

­ client that created the file

­ the tracker URL

­ the name, length, and checksum of each file described in the torrent

No third­party libraries should be used for this project, only the Python standard library.

I aligned my algorithm on this definition of the bittorent protocol:
